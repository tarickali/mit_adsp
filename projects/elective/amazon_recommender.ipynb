    "\n",
    "Welcome to the project on Recommendation Systems. We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "## **Context:**\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business. \n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "## **Dataset:** \n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n",
    "- **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We **will not use this column** to solve the current problem"

Ratings range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5 with the 50th percentile being 5 and the 25-percentile being 4. This indicates that most users rate products very highly. However, a graphical representation of the ratings will better indicate this distribution and the magnitude of its skewness."

Most users rate products as 5 or 4 with very few of them rating products otherwise (3, 2, 1). Interestingly, the above plot seems to exhibit the shape of an exponential distribution, which one would not expect given the typical experience of how users interact and rate products. However, it is unknown if this is due to the quality of the products presented to users or if the users in the data had a lower satisfication threshold."

    "In this notebook, we built and analyzed the performance of recommender systems on an Amazon dataset using four distinct algorithms. We began with a rank-based system using average ratings, then used more advanced approaches with user-user and item-item similiarity-based collaborative filtering, and finally ended with a model-based collaborative filtering (matrix factorization) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze and compare the performance of our models we used the **precision@k**, **recall@k**, **f1_score@k** performance metrics as well as the **rmse** error metric. The performance metrics found after tuning the hyperparameters for each model were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | user_user | item_item | svd | \n",
    "| -------- | ------- | ------ | ----- |\n",
    "| rmse | 0.98 | 0.9751 | 0.9015 |\n",
    "| precision | 0.841 | 0.829 | 0.84 |\n",
    "| recall | 0.886 | 0.892 | 0.882 |\n",
    "| f1_score | 0.863 | 0.859 | 0.86 |\n",
    "\n",
    "As the above table shows, each model performed similarly according to their f1_score with slight variations in recall and precision, while the svd model had a noticably better rmse score. Although the svd model may be considered the best model amongst those founds based on these metrics, from our experimentation with example user-product pairs, we found that each model had significantly different ranges for their predicted ratings. This indicates our performance on this dataset may be improved by using an ensemble of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we will provide a few recommendations that may improve our performance:\n",
    "- Currently product ratings predicted by the models are not corrected for the number of times users rated the product. By adjusting each product's predicted score by substracting `1 / sqrt(rating_count)`, we will have more appropriate representation of the likelihood of user interactions with a product.\n",
    "- The results of these models may be further improved by performing a larger search over hyperparameters. One approach could be to use `RandomizedSearchCV` over a larger set of hyperparameters and then perform `GridSearchCV` over a small sphere of values around the best found from the randomized search.\n",
    "- As mentioned above, we have good reason to believe that there can be performance gains by using an ensemble of all models. The weighting for each model's predictions can be altered in production to perform a form of A/B testing to determine the practical quality of each model. This can later inform better weightings with confidence derived from real interactions.\n",
    "- The dataset provided only contained user and product IDs and did not contain information about their features. As such, our models could not use useful patterns between similar users and products based on explictly observed features. Although this may require more effort and time compared to other recommendations, collecting and labeling features of users and products opens the possibility of using a content-based approach in combination with the our model-based approaches above. This may result in large increases to our overall performance on this dataset as well as combat the cold-start problem of new and less frequent users and products. As a byproduct, we can be more data efficient and reduce the amount of data lost during our preprocessing step.\n",
    "  - Some recommended prelimary features to consider are as follows. For products: price, type/category, age/version, used/new, supplier/seller, reviews/comments. For users: age, location, profession, how often they visit visit Amazon, duration of time spent on Amazon, how often they purchase items, the amount of items purchased, items in their wish list, items in their cart, items returned. Note that these features can be computed automatically on the system and should not be too difficult to gather and update for our model training.\n"
